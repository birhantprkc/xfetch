//! WebAssembly support for plugins, effects and extensions.
//!
//! This module is the single place where xfetch understands WebAssembly. It
//! is split into three layers:
//!
//! - Pure data layers (`detect`, `manifest`, `policy`) always compile; they
//!   need no runtime and power `xfetch wasm inspect`.
//! - The execution layer (`engine`, `host`, `runner`) is gated behind the
//!   `wasm` feature (enabled by default) and links wasmtime plus wasmtime-wasi.
//! - Tooling (`install`, `inspect`) wires artifacts into the config directory
//!   and presents them to the user.
//!
//! The authoritative user documentation lives in `docs/WASM.md`; the wire
//! contract for component guests lives in `wit/xfetch-runtime.wit`.
